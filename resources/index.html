<p>Here is a running list of all of the resources used to create melee.guide.</p>

<p>A Melee Library</p>

<p>Purpose: To compile all information about how to play Super Smash Bros Melee.</p>

<p>If you find a broken link, or have questions or suggestions,</p>

<p>please contact me on <a href="http://smashboards.com/members/splitsontrees.254986/">Smashboards</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Sycorax83/">Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>

<p>[[TOC]]</p>

<h1 id="how-to-search">How to Search</h1>

<p>This library includes a lot of information, but you may find that, sometimes, you need to search for an answer. This is especially true for character discussion threads. I will explain some basic search methods to help you find answers.</p>

<h2 id="this-google-doc">This Google Doc</h2>

<p>If you click anywhere on this document then press Ctrl+F, a little box will appear in the top right corner. Enter keywords and phrases into this box to find instances of them in this document.</p>

<h2 id="smashboards">Smashboards</h2>

<p>This is probably the most important search function to understand since Smashboards can be hard to navigate. In the top right corner of each Smashboards page, there is a search box. Click in it and a number of options will appear in a drop down menu. The most important ones, in my opinion are “Posted by Member,” “search this thread only,” and “search this forum only.” Those will help you focus your search.</p>

<h2 id="reddit">Reddit</h2>

<p>There is actually a lot of good information and discussion on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM">/r/SSBM</a>. You might be able to find useful stuff on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/">/r/smashbros</a>, too. NanchoMan wrote a wonderful bit about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/2xzibx/how_to_use_the_reddit_search_bar/">using the Reddit search bar</a>. Metagame Monday and Thursday General Discussion threads are full of information.</p>

<h2 id="google">Google</h2>

<p>Google knows all. If you are having trouble finding stuff on Smashboards or Reddit, you might have some luck with Google. Google’s search engine is a bit stronger than those. If not stronger, Google is different and may prioritize different results allowing you to find what you want. When searching with Google, use the site function to get results from good sources. Typing “site:[website]” will only return results from that website. Use “site:smashboards.com” or “site:reddit.com/r/ssbm” to refine your search. There are lots of other tips and tricks for searching using google. <a href="http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzA0LzI0LzAyXzIwXzEzXzI5M19maWxlCnAJdGh1bWIJMTIwMHg5NjAwPg/0ac922b6">Here</a> is a good infographic about it by HackCollege.</p>

<h2 id="ssbwiki">SSBWiki</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/Main_Page">SSBWiki</a> is hit or miss. There is good information on there, and there is wrong or outdated information, too. A lot of articles are incomplete also. It is worth checking out because it may have some stuff that is “too simple” to be discussed in guides and write-ups.</p>

<h1 id="frame-data-and-technical-knowledge">Frame Data and Technical Knowledge</h1>

<p>I am not really sure this fits into any of the sections. It is a series of podcasts that are interviews with top players. Each player has three podcasts that cover questions from the community, match review by the player, advice about the player’s main. Some people like podcasts, but I think it is an ineffective way to disseminate information :/</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tinapse.ro/home/coltul-indrumatorului-coach/resurse-materiale-instrumente/W.%20Timothy%20Gallwey%20-%20The%20Inner%20Game%20Of%20Tennis.pdf">(pdf link I don’t feel guilty about since the book is old)</a></p>

<p>This is a book written to address the mental side of performance in sports, specifically tennis. A strange suggestion, but its praises are sung far and wide by smashers who have read it.</p>

<p>“The thesis of this book is that neither mastery nor satisfaction can be found in the playing of any game without giving at least some attention to the relatively neglected skills of the inner game. This is the game that takes place in the mind of the player, and it is played against such obstacles as lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt, and self-condemnation…</p>

<p>The player of the inner game comes to value the art of relaxed concentration above all other skills; he discovers a true basis for self-confidence; and he learns that the secret to winning any game lies in not trying too hard. He aims at the kind of spontaneous performance which occurs only when the mind is calm and seems at one with the body, which finds its own surprising ways to surpass its own limits again and again. Moreover, while overcoming the common hangups of competition, the player of the inner game uncovers a will to win which unlocks all his energy and which is never discouraged by losing.</p>

<p>There is a far more natural and effective process for learning and doing almost anything than most of us realize. It is similar to the process we all use, but soon forgot, as we learned to walk and talk. It uses the so-called unconscious mind and more than the deliberate “self-conscious” mind… This process doesn’t have to be learned; we already know it. All that is needed is to <em>un</em>learn those habits which interfere with it and then to just <em>let it happen</em>.”</p>

<p>This post covers two very different topics, but both are useful. The first topic is about how different characters utilize different traits and styles better than others. Because of this, one can learn different things from playing and analyzing different characters (e.g. <a href="http://smashboards.com/threads/advance-attack-avoid-through-the-lens-of-luigi.389684/">Advance, Attack, Avoid</a>). The second is about approaching and what it means, a more complicated idea than one might first believe.</p>
